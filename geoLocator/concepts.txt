In this project I have learn design pattern that when we have requirement of use a class as dependecny for 
others classes so we will not put our require conditions on that model class so it can handle all other classes, what 
we do is , we create a modal class and make compulsory for all other accessor of this class that they shall make 
themselves compatible to work with modal class. So by this methodology we have decoupled the compatibility logic
and put its responsibility to accessor. Now it will be easily manage. On the other hand if we not use this then 
we are putting every time accessor information in modal class which is burden of irrelvant code on that class.
