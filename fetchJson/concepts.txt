Tpyescript is a decoration guard , who will look user code during development that user shall not remained errors
 in code which will then disturb the core logic behind any algorithm or any other prcoess.

Every entity or value has a type like "zaheer" is string and its type define that it has all methods in its propert 
which are available to type of string.

we can intentionally set type of en entity to restirct to not have wrong value like number in string.

Now in index we have define type of json object as interface and then applied it to response of rest api 
then during development it display the error when I have intentionally put wrong spelling of object key and sever 
can run the code , so i am facing this issue in anitial phase of any logic of my bigger project , so i can easily 
trace it and solved it, if i didn't use type definition then in future when code base will be large and issue 
occured it was very lengthy process to find where string has value of type number.

annotations/variables
Typescript usually pick type from initialized value and then imposed that type on next assigment for that 
variables but if you want to there should be clearification for type then you should have defined variable type
on declaration or intialization of type;

annotations/objects
when using object destructuring then you should annotate properties type 

annotaions/functions
functions parameters and their return condition definition should be define so there will be no confusion that
what output that function will return;

arrays and tuples
type definition of generl arrays will be the same type for entire array while for tuples every element in
array has defferent type and it us commonly used in csv data parsing on server side.

interfaces
define type of object (define each property and their type ) as per requirement than as modal used that type 
for Your required variables that is called interface.

classes
parents container of formation, abstraction , encapsulation of data, so we can use code in sophisticated ,
decorated and standardly fabricated way which is once defined without defining repeatedly for repeated use.
