In this project I have learned how decouple sorting algorithm from type of data 
Just implement  the basic algorithm of sorting and give the rest of work to individual class to complete the requirement to 
perform sorting on data.
Learned when to use abstract classes 
(we directly  cannot instiate object of abstract class , its just for declerafication of methods and properties that the class  
which will inherit it should have all the methods and properties declare in this class );
